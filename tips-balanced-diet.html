            <h2>Include a Variety of Foods</h2>
            <p>Eating a variety of foods from all food groups ensures you get a wide range of nutrients. Incorporate fruits, vegetables, grains, proteins, and dairy into your daily meals. This helps maintain a balanced diet and supports overall health.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="article-container">
            <h2>Portion Control</h2>
            <p>Managing portion sizes is crucial for maintaining a healthy weight. Even healthy foods can contribute to weight gain if eaten in excess. Be mindful of serving sizes, and try using smaller plates to help control portions.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="article-container">
            <h2>Stay Hydrated</h2>
            <h3>Importance of Water</h3>
            <p>Water is essential for every function in your body. It helps regulate temperature, aids digestion, and keeps your skin healthy. Aim to drink at least 8 glasses of water a day.</p>
            <h3>Limit Sugary Drinks</h3>
            <p>Reduce your intake of sugary drinks like sodas and energy drinks, which can add unnecessary calories and lead to weight gain. Opt for water, herbal teas, or fresh juices instead.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="article-container">
            <h2>Limit Processed Foods</h2>
            <p>Processed foods often contain high levels of salt, sugar, and unhealthy fats. Reducing your intake of these foods can lower your risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease and diabetes. Focus on whole, unprocessed foods as much as possible.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="article-container">
            <h2>Balance Your Meals</h2>
            <p>Ensure each meal contains a balance of macronutrients: carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Carbohydrates provide energy, proteins support muscle repair and growth, and fats are essential for brain health. Balancing these nutrients helps maintain energy levels throughout the day.</p>
