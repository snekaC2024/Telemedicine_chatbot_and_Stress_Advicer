            <h2>Start with a Warm-Up</h2>
            <p>Warming up is essential to prepare your muscles and joints for exercise. Start with 5-10 minutes of light cardio such as walking, jogging in place, or cycling. This increases your heart rate and helps prevent injury.</p>

            <h2>Beginner Cardio Routine</h2>
            <p>Cardio exercises are great for building endurance and burning calories. Try this simple routine:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>5 minutes of brisk walking</li>
                <li>10 minutes of alternating between 1 minute of jogging and 1 minute of walking</li>
                <li>5 minutes of cool-down walking</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Repeat this routine 3-4 times a week, gradually increasing the duration as you build endurance.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="article-container">
            <h2>Strength Training Basics</h2>
            <h3>Bodyweight Exercises</h3>
            <p>Strength training is crucial for building muscle and improving overall fitness. Start with bodyweight exercises like squats, push-ups, and lunges. Aim for 2-3 sets of 10-15 repetitions for each exercise.</p>
            <h3>Using Light Weights</h3>
            <p>As you progress, you can incorporate light weights into your routine. Start with dumbbells or resistance bands, focusing on proper form to avoid injury.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="article-container">
            <h2>Flexibility and Stretching</h2>
            <p>Maintaining flexibility is important for overall fitness and injury prevention. Incorporate stretching into your routine after each workout. Focus on major muscle groups, holding each stretch for 20-30 seconds.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="article-container">
            <h2>Cool Down and Recovery</h2>
            <p>After completing your workout, take time to cool down and stretch. This helps reduce muscle soreness and improve flexibility. Ensure you stay hydrated and get plenty of rest to allow your body to recover.</p>
